# Motor schemas architecture

## Task
The task required for this lab activity remains the same as in previous labs.

## Behaviours
Firstly, I defined the primary behaviors I wanted the robot to exhibit:
- ***Phototaxis***: the robot should find a light source and go towards it. 
The foot-bot should reach the target as fast as possible and, once reached it, it should stay close to it (either standing or moving);
- ***Obstacle avoidance***: the robot should avoid collisions with objects (such as walls, boxes and other robots);
- ***Tangential movement***: this behavior involves guiding the robot around an obstacle encountered in its path, enabling it to navigate smoothly without colliding;
- ***Uniform movement***: the robot should go in a given direction;
- ***Random movement***: the robot should also go random if it doesn't detect any light or obstacles in the proximity.

## Implementation
### Potential fields
In *[potential_field.lua](potential_field.lua)*, I established corresponding potential fields for each behavior:
- `attractive_field`:
  - If the *distance* to the light source is less than or equal to the threshold distance *D*, the function calculates a length for the attractive force vector.
  The *length* of the force vector is determined by the ratio of the difference between *D* and the actual *distance* to *D*. 
  This ratio is used to scale the attractive force, with the force being stronger when the robot is closer to the light source.
  - The *angle* of the force vector is set to the input angle parameter, indicating the desired direction of movement.
  - This setup ensures that the robot is attracted to the light source and moves towards it.
- `repulsive_field`:
  - The *length* of the force vector is calculated similarly for both the attractive and repulsive forces.
  - The negative sign is applied to the *angle* parameter for the repulsive force to ensure the robot is pushed away from obstacles.
- `tangential_field`:
  - The *length* of the force vector is set to the distance parameter.
  - The *angle* of the force vector is adjusted by adding *Ï€/2* (90 degrees) to the input angle, enabling clockwise rotation.
  This adjustment ensures that the force vector is perpendicular to the obstacle, directing the robot tangentially around it.
- `uniform_field`: 
  - Used for both uniform movement and random movement.
  - The *length* of the force vector is set to the distance parameter, ensuring that the strength of the force remains consistent regardless of distance.
  - The *angle* of the force vector is set to the input angle parameter, indicating the desired direction of movement.

### Environment
The environment, *[test-motor_schemas.argos](test-motor_schemas.argos)*, is set up to test the laboratory.
Light and proximity sensor rays are activated to visually inspect whether the robot perceives stimuli or not.
Initially, I tested the controller with a single robot in the arena, then scaled up to 10 to ensure functionality in the presence of mobile objects.

### Utilities
*[utilities.lua](utilities.lua)* contains utility functions, and in this lab, I specifically utilized `search_highest_value`, which returns the index corresponding to the maximum value among all sensors.

*[performance.lua](performance.lua)* contains a function for computing the Euclidean distance between the robot's position and the target light source.
I employed this information, based on known positions, to establish the distance threshold *D*.

Within *[vector.lua](vector.lua)*, there are several utility functions provided by the Professor.
Primarily, I utilized the function `vector.vec2_polar_sum(v1,v2)` to add vectors (in polar coordinates) pairwise.

### Controller
*[controller-motor_schemas.lua](controller-motor_schemas.lua)* encapsulates the robot's controller logic.

Some constants used in the code are defined, such as the maximum number of movement steps (`MOVE_STEPS`), maximum velocity (`MAX_VELOCITY`), 
thresholds for light (`LIGHT_THRESHOLD`), proximity (`PROXIMITY_THRESHOLD`), and noise (`NOISE_THRESHOLD`),
as well as the wheel axis length (`L`) and distance (`D`).

The `init` and `reset` functions are equivalent, where the global constant `L` is defined, whose value is obtained with `robot.wheels.axis_length`, and `n_steps` is set to 0.

In the `destroy` function, there are `logs` of the robot's position, the number of steps, and the calculation of the Euclidean distance to verify performance at the end of the simulation.

In the `step` function:
- First, the values of the light and proximity sensors are read, and the corresponding indices for the maximum detected value for each sensor are determined.
- From the indices, I obtain the *value* and *angle* for both sensors, and by multiplying *value* by *D*, I obtain the *distance* from the light.
- Force vectors are calculated for attraction, repulsion, and tangential movement behaviors using the `attractive_field`, `repulsive_field`, and `tangential_field` functions.
- The resulting vectors are summed pairwise using polar coordinates.
- I've added two controls:
  - If the light is detected and there are no obstacles in proximity, then an additional vector for uniform movement is added to the previous result vector. I used the `uniform_field` function passing constant length and an angle proportional to that of the detected light.
  - If the light is not detected, then an additional vector for random movement is added to the previous result vector. I used the `uniform_field` function again passing constant length and an angle obtained with `robot.random.uniform(-math.pi/5,math.pi/5)`.
- Motor commands expressed as translational and angular velocities are converted into differential actions (wheel velocities) using the `converter_from_rototransational_to_differential` function.
- Afterwards, they are scaled to the maximum velocity using the `multiplier` function.
- Finally, the robot's wheel velocities are set based on the obtained results.

## Considerations
- Since I set the tangential movement only in a clockwise direction, the robot will always turn to the right, and it's possible that encountering an obstacle placed in a certain position may force the robot to turn back. 
However, I decided not to allow the possibility of turning left because it got stuck more often in cases where obstacles were positioned in front of the target in a cone shape.
- Personally, I haven't encountered the ***Local Minima*** problem, probably because there was noise in the light and proximity sensors, and perhaps because I also added a constant uniform and random field in some circumstances.
